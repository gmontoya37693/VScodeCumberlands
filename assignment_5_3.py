# Testing:
# Black-box: Input saved=23643.75, v_rate=[0.05, 0.04], expensed=7500
# Output:
# Year 1: $17,325.94 (Rate: 5.00%)
# Year 2: $10,692.23 (Rate: 4.00%)

# White-box: Input saved=130000, v_rate=[0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01], expensed=16835.59475
# Output:
# Year 1: $119,664.41 (Rate: 5.00%)
# Year 2: $108,812.03 (Rate: 4.00%)
# Year 3: $97,417.04 (Rate: 3.00%)
# Year 4: $85,452.29 (Rate: 2.00%)
# Year 5: $72,889.31 (Rate: 1.00%)
# Year 6: $59,698.19 (Rate: 0.00%)
# Year 7: $45,847.50 (Rate: -1.00%)
# Year 8: $31,304.28 (Rate: -2.00%)
# Year 9: $16,033.90 (Rate: -3.00%)
# Year 10: $-0.00 (Rate: -4.00%)

# Summary: Outputs match expected balances for both typical and edge-case
