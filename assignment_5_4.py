        # Testing:
# Black-box: Input salary=50000, p_rate=0.05, workRate=[0.05]*10, retiredRate=[0.05]*10, epsilon=1.0
# Expected: Finds maximum yearly expense so that retirement account is nearly depleted after 10 years.
# Output example:
# Trying expense: 7500.0, balance: 0.0
# Returns: 7500.0

# Error encountered:
# Infinite loop when binary search bounds do not change due to rounding.
# Fix: Increment low and decrement high by 0.01 (one cent) each iteration to ensure progress.
# Removed max_iterations for simplicity in future tests.
# Summary: The function now avoids infinite loops and finds the maximum yearly expense using binary search.

# Change made: Added 'break' statement inside binary search loop to stop when abs(balance) <= epsilon.
# This ensures the loop exits immediately when the balance is within the acceptable margin.
# Verified that the function now terminates as soon as the condition is met, providing the correct maximum yearly expense.

# Verified: With the break statement, the loop stops as soon as abs(balance) <= epsilon.
# Output: Maximum yearly expense is printed and matches expected results.
# Observed: Several "Trying expense" lines near the solution, showing binary search narrowing in.
# No infinite loop or stuck values.
